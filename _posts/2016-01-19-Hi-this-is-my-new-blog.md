Hi there,

today I am excited to start my new blog. I am gonna use my blog to share some thoughts and projects I am working on.

The blog itself is based on [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and I use a jekyll theme called ['the-plain'](https://github.com/heiswayi/the-plain). You can checkout the source code of my blog. It is hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). And the source code is located here [https://github.com/schasse/schasse.github.io](https://github.com/schasse/schasse.github.io).

You can probably soon read about me on my about page [http://blog.sebastianschasse.de/about](http://blog.sebastianschasse.de/about) and hopefully more blog entries.

cheers
schasse
